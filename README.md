# BiCS - Bachelor Semester Project - Semester 3 - 2022 - Paulo's Source files

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository where I host my source files.
This repository hosts my Flappy Bird clone made with Pygame and the code I used to train an AI agent to play my game.

This repository contains 2 folders:

* **src**: contains all the project code written in Python.
* **resources**: contains the sprites/sounds/fonts used in the game.
